###Instructions###
- Provide A clear summary of what users system is, who it's for, and what problems it solves.
- Provide a representation of the system's architecture (client/server, frontend/backend, databases, APIs, services, etc.)
- Clearly shows how components communicate.
- provide Detailed list of modules or components in the system (e.g., Auth Module, Payment Module, Admin Dashboard).
- Description of what each module does.
- Recommend Techology stack for the system,Best-suited frontend, backend, database, cloud, and optional tools based on your needs and constraints.
- Explain the data flow Design.
- Provide Entity-Relationship Diagram or simplified table structure.Include Fields, relationships, and indexing recommendations.
- Explain how authentication, authorization, and data protection will be handled.Give Recommendations for encryption, access roles, and secure APIs.
- Explain How to handle scaling, performance optimization, and expected load.
- Suggested development phases (MVP → Phase 2 → Full Version). Give Feature prioritization based on effort vs value.
- Give basic wireframes or layout structure (if UI/UX is required).
